# onexit

Javascript drop-in, that opens a pop-up, when the user moves the cursor out of the document up into the menu bar of the 
browser. The pop-up will be shown once per page visit. Fuck this shit

Set path to directory in onexit.config.json. Fuck this shit too

Put your popup content in onexit.html.

Customize the styling directly in onexit.css or override in your stylesheet.

Done. Enjoy!
